# For the Reviewers

- The application uses the Fiber framework for handling HTTP requests
- The in-memory storage approach is chosen to simplify the solution for this assignment
- Didn't write any unit test cases
- Error handling is not that great, could have defined all the errors in a single package and use it everywhere
- Haven't added comments in the code
